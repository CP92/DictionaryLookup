## About

This app was built during a weekend hackathon. The hackathon theme was "Alphabet" and the goal was to build a app based on the theme during the weekend. The original idea was to make a app that generated a random collection of letters and searched a dictionary to see if a word could be made from it. That idea was scrapped due to a lack of a useable data set and time constraints, thus a pivot was made to make this app.

The app allows you to simply type in letters into a text field and with each character a search for words starting with that collection of letter is made to the datamuse api. The interface is updated in real time with words and their definitions.
